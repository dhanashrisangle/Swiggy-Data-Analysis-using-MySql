# Swiggy-Data-Analysis-using-MySql

*## Project Overview:

   ---------      This repository contains SQL queries for analyzing a dataset from Swiggy, a popular food delivery platform.
         

*### Purpose of the Project:
                             To demonstrate proficiency in SQL by performing various analyses and queries on a dataset 
                             representing Swiggy, a popular food delivery platform.


*### Data Source: 
                  The dataset was obtained from google. The dataset contains information about restaurant name, restaurant address,
                  ratings, city, food items, menu catagory, cuisine, price per person, veg or nonveg on Swiggy platform.


*## Project Steps:
*### Data Import:
                 Imported Swiggy data from csv file contaning all the information about restaurants and all.


*### SQL Querying:
                  Utilize MySQL to read and manipulate the dataset.

               
*### Data Manipulation:
                        Used SQL functions and clauses (e.g., DISTINCT, COUNT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING)
                        to filter, aggregate, and analyze data.


*### Skills Demonstrated:
                          SQL, Data Analysis, Query Optimization.


*### Key Achievements:

                    * Developed complex SQL queries incorporating DISTINCT, COUNT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING clauses.  
                    
                    * Leveraged SQL functions like AVG, MAX for calculating averages, maximum values, etc.                                                         
                    
                    * Implemented self-joins for correlating data within the same table.
                  
                    * Optimized query performance for efficient data retrieval.
